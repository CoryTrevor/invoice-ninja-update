# Invoice-Ninja-Update
Bash script for updates
  
Add update.sh file one directory above public_html  
To run: bash update.sh  
  
Notes:  
The script assumes the Invoice Ninja files are directly inside public_html and not in a subfolder. If your public folder has a different name or you use a differnent folder structuree, update the script accordingly.  
  
  
For the # Update config code section it assumes PHP8.1 is in /usr/local/php81/bin/php-cli. If php8.1 is in a different directory on your server then update the script accordingly.
